## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I was able to edit my portfolio website to suit the information i want it to carry. i used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for this site
I opted for a simple layout that provide easy navigation between pages

## My users will be able to:
View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
See where to find everything

All images were captured in the image folder
The homepage which also doubles as the landing page is captured in the index.html file
The about page that introduces me and projects done so far is captured in the about.html file
The Contact page which contains how to reach out to me for my service is captured in the contact.html file


## Building and Deploying project
The project was forked and clone into my device working directory.
Changes where made and code was pushed into the public repo on Github
Code was published using netlify
